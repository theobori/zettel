#+title: 3. Incident response

An incident response is a respose to an incident that happens (nothing more).

Most of the time, alerts are set up in function of the [[file:../../Monitoring/Service Level/Objective.org][Objective]] and [[file:../../Monitoring/Service Level/Agreement.org][Agreement]].

- Constant evaluation is needed to make sure that alerts are useful and reacted to correctly.
- Something cool is to review the past week alerts to evaluate if any change is needed.

Also see [[file:../../Monitoring/ICS.org][ICS]].
