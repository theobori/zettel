#+title: Special shell variables

- The =IFS= (Internal Field Separator) variable is used to separate words in strings.
- =$$= evaluates to the parent PID
- =$!= evaluates to the last executed command PID
- =$_= evaluates to the last argument used
- =$-= evaluates to the current shell options

A good practice is to surround these special variables with double quotes.
