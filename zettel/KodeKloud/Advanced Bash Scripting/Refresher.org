- TheÂ =shift= keyword can be useful to move down the arguments by one position.
- The =nohup= command is used to make a process tty independant, a process can still run if the tty is closed.
- The =compgen= command gives a list of keywords, built-in commands, etc.
- The =/usr/bin/env bash= shebang is a good practice.
