#+title: Derivation

Apackage, a "construction task" in a [[file:../Nix.org][Nix]] expressions context. It's the Nix building block and is immutable.

Also always based directly or indirectly on the =derivation= function built in the [[file:../Nix.org][Nix]] VM (internal).

** Build steps
1. Instantiation/Evaluation
   1. Parse
   2. Interprets
   3. Returns a [[file:Derivation/drv file.org][drv file]] during the evaluation
2. Realise/Build time
   1. Build input derivations within the [[file:Derivation/drv file.org][drv file]]
   2. Build output derivations within the [[file:Derivation/drv file.org][drv file]]

** Output hash
The hash of the out path is based solely on the input [[file:file:Derivation.org][Derivation]] in the current version of Nix, [[../Nix.org][Nix]] on the contents of the build product.
