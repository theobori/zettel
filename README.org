* My public zettelkasten

[[https://github.com/theobori/zettel/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml][https://github.com/theobori/zettel/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg]]

This website is the public [[file:zettel/Glossaire/Zettelkasten.org][Zettelkasten]] of [[https://theobori.cafe][Th√©o Bori]], where I write down things I learn and find interesting. Some notes are written in English, but the overwhelming majority are written in French.

Not all notes are IT-related!

The notes are managed with the [[file:zettel/GNU.org][GNU]] [[file:zettel/Livres/Masterring Emacs, Mickey Petersen/Emacs.org][Emacs]] Org [[file:zettel/Livres/Masterring Emacs, Mickey Petersen/2. The ways of Emacs/Mode.org][Mode]] from a [[file:zettel/NixOS.org][NixOS]] machine.
